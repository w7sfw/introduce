# w7sfw – WordPress Firewall

**w7sfw** is a security-first WordPress Firewall designed to stop real-world threats
*before* they reach your WordPress core or hosting infrastructure.

Unlike traditional WordPress security plugins, w7sfw focuses on **infrastructure-level protection**,
ensuring clean traffic, reduced attack surface, and stable performance.

## Why w7sfw?

Most WordPress security solutions operate *inside* WordPress.
By the time they act, malicious requests have already consumed server resources.

w7sfw takes a different approach.

- 🔒 Blocks attacks at the edge
- 🚫 Stops malware, exploits, brute-force, and abusive bots
- ⚡ Reduces server load and unnecessary PHP execution
- 🧠 Designed for real threats, not checkbox security

## Key Features

- Infrastructure-level WordPress Firewall
- Real traffic filtering (human vs malicious bots)
- Protection against:
  - Brute-force attacks
  - Exploit scanning
  - Malware delivery
  - Credential stuffing
- Scalable for single sites or large WordPress ecosystems

---

## Who Is It For?

w7sfw is built for:

- Developers managing WordPress at scale
- Hosting providers & infrastructure teams
- Businesses that cannot afford downtime or defacement
- Security-conscious site owners

Security should be **invisible**, **reliable**, and **boring**.
That’s exactly what w7sfw aims to be.

## Philosophy

> WordPress security should not be a plugin problem.  
> It should be an infrastructure decision.

w7sfw is inspired by modern infrastructure thinking
(similar to how Kubernetes abstracts complexity behind the scenes),
bringing that mindset to WordPress security.
